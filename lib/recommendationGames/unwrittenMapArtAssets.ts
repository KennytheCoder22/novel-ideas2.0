// Local asset manifest for The Unwritten Map's presentation layer.
//
// Only Mossmere/frog-parliament focal art and shared cartographic framing
// chrome shipped as real local assets (PR #305). Every other encounter,
// choice, and result relies on bounded deterministic vector/CSS composition
// identities instead (see unwrittenMapPresentationContract.ts). This module
// is pure data (a path manifest) plus a couple of pure lookup helpers; it
// does not touch the filesystem itself so it stays safe to import from any
// runtime. Filesystem existence checks live in the Node-only validator.

/**
 * Maps a bounded local-asset id to its path relative to the repository
 * root. Keys are grouped by purpose:
 *  - `frog-parliament-*`: exact per-choice/result/encounter art for the
 *    Mossmere "Reed Parliament" frog-parliament scenario, mapped by the
 *    game's authoritative choice ids (not by any baked/legacy numbering).
 *  - `shared-frame-*`: framing chrome shared across many screens (entry,
 *    journal, map, and Mossmere-specific backdrop panels). These are not
 *    per-encounter focal art, but are tracked here so the validator can
 *    confirm every local asset PR #305 shipped is accounted for and still
 *    present on disk.
